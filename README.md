# Beer Board Solo Project
This is my capstone project for Prime Digital Academy.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate my ability to develop a full-stack application from bottom to top. I chose to create an application in which bars and breweries could dynamically create and update their current beer selection. Customers could then search the bar and see all available beers, relevant info, and some fun extranious information.

Two weeks were slotted to create this project from conception to demonstration. I used MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS, Passport, Jade, CSS, Angular Material, Mongoose, and Grunt. I also integrated with the BreweryDB API for beer searching and saving.
